<p>My name is Okuma Francis Ikechukwu, 19, currently in my second year at the university of Nigeria Nsukka looking to become a fullstack web dev. It's just a should i say short term goal I am sure I'll find a career i will be willing to pursue in tech </p>

<p>Still learning HTML, hopefully by this same time in 2024. I'll be good at CSS, javascript, react and other backend languages.</p>
